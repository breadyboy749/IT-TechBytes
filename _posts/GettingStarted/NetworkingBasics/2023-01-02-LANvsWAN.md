I think that having a good understanding of networking is essential to landing your first IT job and is a super important aspect as you progress your IT career. No matter what role you end up in, knowing how networking works and how computers talk to one another is key to your success and will make you stand out from the crowd. To start things off we are going to begin talking about what a LAN and WAN network are.

# What is a LAN Network?
LAN is an acroynm that stands for local area network and refers to a computer network composed of IP addresses that fall into what is called the `private IP address space`. You can check out our article on What is an IP Address to learn more about this topic. One of the easiest ways to think about a LAN network is to think of your internet network that you have at home. You probably have one WiFi network that you connect all of your devices to at home. That is a LAN network!

<br/>

## How a LAN network works
Lets stick with the example of your network at home to better explain how a LAN network works and how it is setup. In your home network you will have a signle router, usually provided by your ISP that you use to connect your devices to. That router is going to end up doing double duty by serving as your router (default gateway) and your wireless access point for all the devices in your home.

<br/>

Lets looks at this example below. In this digram we have a basic rendition of a home network. In the middle we have our router (It's wireless network is named TechBytes-Home) and we have a couple of devices connected via WiFi and one single wired device. You will also see there is a single connection coming from the router marked as ISP Connection going out to the Internet.

You will notice each device in the diagram is also assigned an IP address. This is the role of the router. Each device that connects to your network must have its own unique IP address and when a new device connects to the router it asks for an IP address. This is using a proctocol named `DHCP` that we cover in another of our [Getting Started Articles](http://it-techbytes.com/gettingstarted_intro/Getting-Started-in-IT).
<br/>

If you thnk about your current home network you probably have a lot more devices connected that what is shown in the diagram so your router has to assign all of them an IP address and keep track of all of those addresses it assigned. Routers are specifically designed to do this and keep what is called a routing table of all the devices connected to your network. 

<br/>

If you read our [What is an IP Address] article then you know there is a finite number of IP addresses available for each computer device to use so how do all of these devices in your home talk to the internet without having the same IP address as a device your neighbor does? More than likely your devices do have the same IP addresses as devices connected to your neighbors home network, and really everybody's home networks. How does this work then? How do these devices talk to the internet and not interrupt each other? That is where `NAT` comes in.

<br/>

### What is NAT?
NAT stands for Network Address Translation and is a concept that I did not understand for a long time when I first started learning about computers and networking. Once you understand the concept it seems obvious but isn't something that is common knowledge when it comes to using the internet as for the most part it operates completely in the background, but is one of the most important features of networking that makes the internet work.

<br/>

At the beginning of the internet all computer networking was based around IPv4 addresses where there are 4 billion different addresses that can exist which was more than enough at the time. As more and more devices joined the internet, it became clear that a solution was needed to address (no pun intended) this issue.

<br/>

### How does NAT work?

NAT is handled by the router. It translates your devices local IP address into something that can be broadcasted out to the external internet. Remember the problem with the limited IP addresses? Well just because there are only so many IP addresses available, doesn't mean that any person should be limited to the number of devices that they can have that can talk to the internet. If everyone's personal devices were directly on the internet though there would certainly be some issues. With NAT you can have as many devices in your local network as you want, as many as your router will support! The routers job is to take all of those internal IP addresses and translate them to one signle external IP address that will then go out to whatever resource you have requested.

Lets look again at this diagram of our TechBytes-Home network. I have removed a couple of things to make it easier to look at for this example. Lets say that the computer with the IP address of 192.168.1.2 wants to go to Google.com. For that to happen the computer requests the Google.com page. The request is received by the router and the router knows exactly what to do. It takes that request and forwards it on to the internet via the ISP connection. When the router forwards that request on it does not use the IP address (192.168.1.2) that it assigned to the computer though. It actually uses an IP address that was assigned by the ISP to the router. Remember how we said whenever a device connects to your router it must have an IP address? Well it is the same for the router. When the router connects to the ISP's network, it must receive an IP address from the ISP. This is known as your `External IP Address`
