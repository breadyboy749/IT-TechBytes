excerpt: "DHCP is responsible for assigning IP addresses to computers on a network. Without DHCP it would be extremely hard to do any networking at the scale required in todays technology focused world."

DHCP is a networking protocol that stands for `Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol` and is what is in charge of assigning IP addresses to devices when they are added to a network. DHCP helps a new device obtain information for the network so that it is able to successfully connect to the router and access the internet. Without DHCP you would have to spend a lot of time manually inputting your network settings into each device that you wanted to add to the network, and then also make sure each device you setup had a different IP address so there are no conflicts. This can be very tricky to keep track of for a home network with maybe 10-20 devices, now imagine a corporate network with thousands! It would be impossible to keep track of all that information without some overlaps and would take a lot of time to get just right. That is why we have DHCP!
