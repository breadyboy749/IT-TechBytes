Hi, my name is Brad and I run IT-TechBytes. I am a Cybersecurity Engineer who loves anything and everything tech. I started my career working on the help desk and worked my way up through a couple of different IT roles while finishing up school before I transitioned to the security world. My approach to IT is being someone who is a "jack of all trades, master of some". That is obviously a little tongue in cheek but is something that has been extremely beneficial in my career. Having knowledge about a lot of different aspects of IT, doing it at home, getting out of your comfort zone, and learning as much as you can from others will be endlessly beneficial and I hope to pass that along here on this blog.

My passion to help others is why I created this blog. I had a lot of friends come up to me asking how they could get started in IT. They would ask me, "Hey Brad I want to get started in IT, what should I learn/study?". That seemed easy enough, I mean one of the most important skills in IT is being able to Google things, piece of cake, right? Wrong. Looking around I was surprised how difficult it was to find a single place that had good, informative, introductory information that covered the topics I believed to be important to someone new to IT. Everything was either too surface level or too technical with no real good in between for someone who was willing to learn but wasn't ready to get lost in the extreme detail of a Microsoft help doc.

My goal with IT-TechBytes is to offer a single place that has all the information you would need to get your career started in IT. My Getting Started Series covers a wide variety of topics from all different corners of IT to help provide the information necessary to land your first IT job and stand out from the crowd. Along with the Getting Started Series, articles include topics on security, home networking, home lab, 3D printing, and really anything else I feel like writing about.
